# Multi Cloud Platform + Region deployment of HashiCorp Vault Enterprise with Terraform

This idea came up while thinking of how I can prepare myself for the Vault Professional certification.  
Basically I need to be able to practice with Vault Enterprise clusters and set up replication.  
Within this setup I want to try a master/performance/disaster cluster replication setup.

So, I decided to try to accomplish the following with the rule of thirds:

- [x] Create 3 separate Vault clusters.
- [x] All 3 clusters consist of 3 Vault servers.
- [x] All 3 clusters are spread over 3 cloud providers.
  - [x] AWS
  - [x] Azure
  - [x] GCP
- [ ] Within these 3 cloud providers, all cluster nodes are automatically spread over 3 zones within one randomly chosen region.
  - [x] AWS
  - [ ] Azure
  - [x] GCP
- [x] Have Vault Enterprise installed on these 3*3 VM instances.
  - [x] AWS
  - [x] Azure
  - [x] GCP
- [x] Have the Vault ports publicly accessible between the 3*3 VM instances.
  - [x] AWS
  - [x] Azure
  - [x] GCP
- [x] Have Terraform generate an Ansible inventory which then can be used for deployment
- [ ] Have Ansible deploy the general configuration

I managed to do all the thinking and scripting for one provider, in this case GCP.  
So this now can act as a sort of blueprint for the others (Azure + AWS).

I ran into some issues of when I was choosing my own region and zones, that there weren't enough resources available, so I shifted towards that Terraform would pick a random region for me and within that region choose 3 separate available zones. Of course if this was an environment that would have been deployed on a single cloud provider, one should use multiple regions as well. However, since we are doing this on multiple cloud providers, we somehow have this covered.  

And it's all for testing purposes, remember that.

So, built the majority of the Azure functionality into the scripts.  
I still need to figure out how to spread the VM's across different zones.  
But hey, there's always room for improvement.

AWS is also ready.

Woke up early today (kids...you get so much joy...) so what better way to start the day than with continuing our saga.  
So, I like Terraform, but I like Ansible even more. So now that our infrastructure is ready, I wanted to continue the configuration management with Ansible. To do this, I added a template and another Terraform resource that creates an inventory for me, that can then be used by Ansible.  

But...first I needed to re-organize the directory structure, since a whole lot of files in the root is a bit messy.  
After that I managed to get that inventory file pretty quickly and I thought it would be nice to show some screenshots of the end-state of the `terraform plan` and then the Ansible part.

And last but not least, why don't throw in the output of `terraform graph` for some light reading...simple right?

I also created a vault role, which is 90% done I think. Need some more time to think it over and then proceed with testing.
